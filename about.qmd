I'm a senior statistician at [Swisstransplant](https://www.swisstransplant.org/) with professional qualifications in medical research and statistics. I'm also lecturer in biostatistics and good research practice at the [Center for Reproducible Science](https://www.crs.uzh.ch/), a competence center of the University of Zurich.
