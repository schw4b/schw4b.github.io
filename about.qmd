I'm a senior researcher with professional qualification in statistics and medical research. My main focus at [Swisstransplant](https://www.swisstransplant.org/) is risk prediction in organ transplantation (prognosis), developing novel data science tools to assist quality control, and statistical reporting of the transplantation activity in Switzerland.

I am also a member of the scientific committee of the [Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS)](https://www.stcs.ch/), a founding member of the interest group [Statistics in Organ Transplantation (SOT)](https://sites.google.com/view/statistics-in-transplantation/startseite), and a guest researcher at the [CRS](https://www.crs.uzh.ch/) (University of Zurich).

## Interests

* Clinical prediction models in kidney and liver transplantation
* Statistical methods for quality control in organ donation
* Statistical reporting in organ transplantation
* Statistical programming and software packages (R)
* Data visualization and analytics dashboards (R Shiny, Plotly)
* Dynamic, reproducible reporting in data analysis (R Quarto)
