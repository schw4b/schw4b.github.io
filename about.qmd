---

I'm a senior statistician and researcher with professional qualifications in statistics and medical research. My main focus at [Swisstransplant](https://www.swisstransplant.org/) is:

* risk prediction in kidney and liver transplantation (prediction models for prognosis)
* analysis of the waiting list to estimate probability of transplantation
* development of methodology for quality control
* statistical reporting of national transplant activity

I am also a member of the scientific committee of the [Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS)](https://www.stcs.ch/), and a founding member of the interest group [Statistics in Organ Transplantation (SOT)](https://sites.google.com/view/statistics-in-transplantation/startseite). Furthermore, I am a lecturer in biostatistics and good research practice at the [Center for Reproducible Science](https://www.crs.uzh.ch/), a competence center of the University of Zurich.
