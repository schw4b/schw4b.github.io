Without statistics, data have only minimal meaning.\nMy view is that all data are rubbish without proper statistics. Nevertheless, the glorification of data has evolved over the last decades and continues to do so. An example is the front cover of the magazine Science from 2011. It is a collage of words, but only one stands out in large letters: “data.”\nWe are indeed very hungry for data. However, I don’t believe data should take center stage. What is more important is how we perform statistics on the data.\nI tried to find the word “statistics” on the Science front cover but could not find it. Can you see it? Maybe the word “data” should be a bit smaller to leave more room for the word “statistics,” the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.\nNevertheless, many medical studies are conducted with little or no involvement of adequately trained statisticians, and the same is true for scientific peer review [1]. Many researchers don’t use statistics properly. They might not know enough about it, or they might ignore expert advice. Statisticians are often only involved at the end of a study to analyze the data despite being specialists in helping researchers clarify the question and designing the study from scratch. Often, research projects do not include enough funding for statistical work.\nIt sounds absurd, but data is largely overvalued these days, and statistics is largely undervalued."

    "text": "Big data\nAnother example of the glorification of data is the term Big Data.\nWhat does big data even mean? Often omics data is mentioned, for example, transcriptional, epigenetic, proteomic and metabolomic data [2].\nBig data may not be the latest advancement of biomedicine in tackling unsolved problems. Instead, it is our defeat against data-hungry methods from machine learning, a hyped discipline also known as artificial intelligence or simply “AI.” However, 4,000 biomarkers times 200 patients are not big data; the sample size is still N=200, and I consider this a small study. For a prediction model for prognosis, for example, I would instead prefer four clinically relevant variables from 2,000 patients, even though this reflects only 1% of the data in the former example. Don’t be too impressed by the width of a data set.\nToo much data can make data analysis harder, but this is often unrecognized. The unsystematic collection of high-dimensional data, when data sets are more “wide” than “long,” can lead to more questions than answers. For example, the failure of protein cancer biomarker research [3] or the failure of the Human Brain Project [4]. Learning from the past, the combination of big data and overhyped promises is a reason for concern.\nThe catchphrase “let the data speak for itself” is misleading because data rarely have meaning without context. To extract valuable insights, you need a good question and the appropriate method to answer it. Think about your favorite restaurant and dish: imagine being served only unprepared raw food. That’s what data are basically without a statistical analysis; it’s just the ingredients, the uncooked parts. Data on their own are inedible food. In fact, data on their own is pretty dumb.\nWhile data are dumb, more data can be even dumber. Let me explain this. You may object that more data will always lead to less uncertainty. This is, in principle, true. In reality, though, I can see lots of different ways that large data sets could be explored, analyzed, and reanalyzed until we get the result we want or until the model fits the data. Then, this process only appears to reduce the uncertainty when looking at the p-values and standard errors. More likely, the process by which the data were analyzed has increased our uncertainty, but this is often unrecognized. It is a fallacy called the garden of forking paths.\nExcessive analytic attempts generate phantom degrees of freedom [5], which is one of the many ways dark statistics can deceive us. We can only trust our statistical results if we don’t torture the data too much.\n\n\n\nGarden of Forking Paths, Parque Juan Carlos I, Madrid, Spain. (Photo by Victor on Unsplash)"

It requires specialist work. And yes, mistakes can be made in this process [6]. Why can’t AI do all the difficult work for us?\nStatistical software once tried to create the illusion that a nice graphical interface could enable statistics at the push of a button. The exact opposite has happened with the R programming language. We moved away from pressing buttons to writing code, which, by the way, is reproducible and verifiable.\nI recently discovered a website with yet another doomed attempt to make statistics easy: an AI-powered statistics tool.\n\nIt makes complex data analytics accessible to anyone, eliminating the need for advanced technical knowledge or expertise. —from a website about an AI-based statistics tool\n\nHow does it work?

That will be the gloomy future, it seems.\nIronically, the tool has the same name as an assassinated Roman emperor. This is not a very good omen for the tool. Maybe its future is already doomed, as we are all going to be very disappointed with AI doing our statistical analyses.\nMaybe, just maybe, AI will be terrible at being a personal statistical assistant. Maybe AI is much better at misusing statistics. It may be the perfect p-hacking machine. AI is misused in many ways to produce fake images, fake texts, fake human voices, and fake videos. Why not fake statistics? AI confuses the real with the unreal, and why can’t this also be applied to scientific data? The perfect tool for data fabrication in the future. Or, as Cathy O’Neil said, a new weapon of math destruction [7]. AI will do more harm than good, and in the future, we will need more people like Elisabeth Bik, who can spot fake research [8]."

Say, the variables have been selected as the clinically most relevant prognostic variables based on the literature and expert knowledge.\nIn a second approach, I generated some high-dimensional data with many more variables than patients (wide data).\nBut first, I needed to write a short function tidy_lm() to produce a tidy output from a linear regression model; this is just cosmetics.\n\n\nCode\n# helper function for lm output\ntidy_lm &lt;- function(fit) {\n  \n  sfit =  summary(fit)\n  lower  = confint(fit)[,1]\n  upper  = confint(fit)[,2]\n  betas  = coef(fit)\n  effect = sprintf(\"%.2f\", betas)\n  ci     = sprintf(\"from %.2f to %.2f\", lower, upper)\n  \n  tab = data.frame(effect = effect,\n                   ci     = ci,\n                   pvalue = swt::tidy_pvalues(sfit$coefficients[,4]))\n  \n  colnames(tab) = c(\"Effect estimate\", \"95% CI\", \"p-value\")\n  return(tab)\n}\n\n\n\nLong data\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(2024)\n\nSNR = 0.65 # corresponds to 20% explained variance R^2\nN = 2000 # number of patients\nq = 4 # number of predictors\n\n# generate data for a study\ndata = array(rnorm(N*q), dim = c(N, q))\nnoise = rnorm(N) # generate standard normal errors\ny = 0.5*data[,1] + 0.3*data[,2] + 0.2*data[,3] + 1/sqrt(SNR)*noise\n\n\nI simulated data for \\(N = 2000\\) patients and \\(q = 4\\) variables. I assumed the three prognostic variables (\\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\)) were uncorrelated and related to the outcome using an additive model. The true effects were \\(\\beta_1 = 0.5\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 0.3\\), and \\(\\beta_3 = 0.2\\). For the unrelated variable \\(x_4\\), we had \\(\\beta_4 = 0\\). I added some noise so that the explained variance was about 20% (\\(R^2\\)). Below are the results, see Table 1.\n\n\nCode\nd = data.frame(y = y, x1 = data[,1], x2 = data[,2], x3 = data[,3], x4 = data[,4])\nfit = lm(y ~ ., data = d)\ntidy_lm(fit)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Results from a regression model fitted with long data using simulated data from N=2000 patients.\n\n\n\nEffect estimate\n95% CI\np-value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.00\nfrom -0.05 to 0.06\n0.96\n\n\nx1\n0.49\nfrom 0.43 to 0.54\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx2\n0.31\nfrom 0.25 to 0.37\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx3\n0.23\nfrom 0.17 to 0.29\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx4\n-0.01\nfrom -0.07 to 0.04\n0.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe p-values for the first three variables were statistically significant. This basically means that the data were very incompatible with our null model that the true effects were zero (my lawyers helped me with the wording of this sentence). For \\(x_4\\), the p-value was statistically non-significant. But this is all not really interesting, is it? And I don’t particularly like to focus on the results in terms of statistical significance.\nMuch more interesting than the p-values were the effect estimates. Since I was the creator of the data, I could see that the estimates were close to the true effects, but not exactly. For the effect estimates to match the true effects even better, we would need even more data (tens of thousands of patients). But I think it was quite acceptable.\n\n\nWide data\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(2024)\n\nSNR = 0.65 # corresponds to 20% explained variance R^2\nN = 200 # number of patients\nq = 4000 # number of biomarkers\n\n# generate data for a study\ndata = array(rnorm(N*q), dim = c(N, q))\nnoise = rnorm(N) # generate standard normal errors\ny = 0.5*data[,1] + 0.3*data[,2] + 0.2*data[,3] + 1/sqrt(SNR)*noise\n\npvalues = rep(NA, q)\nfor (i in 1:q) { # iterate across biomarkers\n  d = data.frame (y = y, x = data[, i]) # univariable screening\n  fit = lm(y ~ x, data = d)\n  stats = summary(fit)\n  pvalues[i] = stats$coefficients[2,4]\n}\n\n\nNext, I increased the amount of data by a factor of 100. However, I did not increase the sample size in terms of the number of patients. Instead, I created data with \\(q = 4000\\) biomarkers (high-dimensional data). Since these may be expensive and complex measurements, I decreased the sample size to \\(N = 200\\). For each biomarker, I estimated a univariable model and used a cutoff of \\(p \\le 0.05\\) for screening (univariable screening). I know it is a really bad idea, but since so many papers have done it, it shouldn’t hurt anyone to do it just one more time.\nLet’s now pretend we knew that \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\) were the relevant biomarkers. The regression results from the same model as above (\\(x_1\\) to \\(x_4\\)) are shown below in Table 2.\n\n\nCode\nd = data.frame (y = y, x1 = data[,1], x2 = data[,2], x3 = data[,3], x4 = data[,4])\nfit = lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4, data = d)\ntidy_lm(fit)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Results from a regression model fitted with wide data using simulated data form N=200 patients.\n\n\n\nEffect estimate\n95% CI\np-value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.05\nfrom -0.21 to 0.12\n0.58\n\n\nx1\n0.47\nfrom 0.31 to 0.63\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx2\n0.20\nfrom 0.02 to 0.38\n0.026 *\n\n\nx3\n0.24\nfrom 0.07 to 0.41\n0.005 **\n\n\nx4\n0.07\nfrom -0.10 to 0.24\n0.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effect estimates were more off from the truth, particularly \\(x_2\\), and the confidence intervals were much wider. This was not surprising as the sample size was only \\(N = 200\\). All in all, we are much more uncertain; though, the p-values for \\(x_1\\) to \\(x_3\\) were still statistically significant. However, the larger uncertainty was not the main problem.\n\n\nCode\nk = sum(pvalues  &lt;= 0.05)\npvalues.adj = p.adjust(pvalues, method = \"fdr\")\nk.adj = sum(pvalues.adj  &lt;= 0.05)\n\n\nThe main problem was we didn’t know that \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\) were the relevant biomarkers. Using univariable screening, with \\(p \\le 0.05\\) for variable selection, a striking 214 out of a total of 4000 variables were statistically significant; this matches up with the alpha level of 5%.\nI tried to adjust the p-values to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at 5% using the Benjamini & Hochberg procedure; however, only \\(x_1\\) remained statistically significant. So, this only partially helped. I wanted more specificity, and I had to pay with sensitivity. It seems to be really difficult to get the correct model with such a large data set. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack.\nIn the final step, perhaps out of desperation, I opted for a middle way: instead of using an unadjusted threshold of 5% or an FDR of 5%, I applied an unadjusted threshold of \\(p \\le 0.001\\). The results are shown in Table 3.\n\n\nCode\nidx = which(pvalues &lt;= 0.001) # select variables with arbitrary threshold\nd = data.frame(y = y, x = data[, idx]) \nfit = lm(y ~ ., data = d)\ntab = tidy_lm(fit)\n# add variable names\nrownames(tab)[2:(length(idx) + 1)] = paste0(\"x\", idx)\ntab\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Results from a regression model fitted with wide data and using univariable screening to find relevant biomarkers.\n\n\n\nEffect estimate\n95% CI\np-value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.01\nfrom -0.17 to 0.14\n0.86\n\n\nx1\n0.36\nfrom 0.20 to 0.51\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx602\n-0.34\nfrom -0.50 to -0.17\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx971\n0.19\nfrom 0.03 to 0.35\n0.017 *\n\n\nx2186\n0.28\nfrom 0.12 to 0.45\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx3748\n0.14\nfrom -0.01 to 0.30\n0.073 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this step, we have left the realm of science facts and entered the realm of science fiction. The results above show voodoo statistics with statistically significant results for the variables that are pure noise (except \\(x_1\\)). The model explained 28% of the variance (adj. \\(R^2\\)).\nI think I tortured the data too much. Surely, a journal would publish such statistically significant results!\n\n\nSo what?\nSo what does this mean? I find the analysis of high-dimensional data extremely difficult. Certainly, there are situations where the problem is not so extreme, but there may be situations where the issue is even more extreme. It is almost impossible to find the relevant “truths” in the data when trying too many different things (the garden of forking paths).\nYou may object that the simulations I made were too pessimistic. Yes, but we often don’t know how good the signal-to-noise ratio is in clinical data. And completely in the dark, we must be very careful in the process of analyzing high-dimensional data, particularly when we use model selection. Univariable screening is well-known for providing flawed results, but it is still widely used today (or widely misused, I should say).\nThe process of how the result was obtained is much more important than the result itself.\nFor further reading, see “How to Do Bad Biomarker Research” by Frank Harrell [12].

    "text": "Have you ever been confused about data and evidence? Frankly, I find myself confused in data many times. The real goal isn’t to eliminate confusion entirely but to reduce it and gain some sense of certainty.\nOne such thing that can be truly confusing in medical research is confounding.\nBut what is confounding? Confounding bias occurs when a third variable is associated with a risk factor (or treatment) and also influences the health outcome, leading to a wrong result. This can either create a false relationship or hide a real one.\nI make up an example. Say, doctors have higher cancer rates. The confounding factor may be smoking if doctors tend to smoke more, and smoking causes cancer. So, no, being a doctor per se does not cause cancer at all.\nAfter a literature search, I found two excellent examples from published medical studies where confounding occurred.\nIn the 1990s, observational studies suggested that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women [1]. However, this association was most likely false. Subsequent randomized controlled trials and a meta-analysis from 2002 found no evidence that HRT reduced the risk of CVD [2]. The apparent benefits were likely influenced by confounders such as socioeconomic status and education. Lower socioeconomic status is a strong risk factor for CVD, coronary artery disease, and many other adverse health outcomes. Additionally, women using HRT tend to have higher socioeconomic status, which may partially explain their better outcomes in earlier studies.\nA 2016 observational study compared tracheal intubation to bag-valve-mask ventilation during pediatric cardiac arrest [3]. The study found that survival was lower in those children intubated compared with those not intubated. The authors concluded that the study does not support early tracheal intubation for pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest. However, the study suffered from confounding by indication [4]. It was likely that children with a more severe condition and worse overall prognosis had a greater probability of being intubated. Consequently, the treatment group showed a higher risk of death.\nThe two examples show that confounding can confuse doctors in making the right choice based on solid evidence. Needless to say, this can potentially harm patients."

    "text": "How can we reduce confounding?\nThere are several ways to address confounding in medical research. One is study design, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are highly effective and provide strong evidence.\nSay, we are interested in the therapeutic effect of hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) in kidney transplantation. We could perform an RCT and randomize the kidneys into a control group (standard cold storage) and an intervention group (HMP).\nHowever, an RCT is not always possible. For example, if we want to assess the risk of donation after brain death (DBD) versus donation after circulatory death (DCD) kidney transplants, it is not possible to randomly assign kidneys to either group. Similarly, just as we cannot randomly assign individuals to be smokers or non-smokers, certain real-world conditions make randomization impossible.\nThere are also other approaches to tackle confounding, including matching and propensity score methods, which pair participants with similar clinical characteristics to reduce confounding [5,6]. It is important to carefully select the matching variables, choose an appropriate matching method, and perform a diagnostic assessment of the matching process. Additionally, stratified analysis helps control for confounding by analyzing data within specific subgroups.\nIn the remainder of this post, I will focus on another key approach: multivariable regression modeling. This method allows researchers to account for multiple confounders simultaneously by including them as covariates in a regression model, helping to isolate the true relationship between the exposure and outcome of interest."

    "text": "Everything will mislead you except a model\n\nA model is a lie that helps you see the truth. —Howard E. Skipper\n\nI’m a big fan of model-based approaches [7,8]. Models provide the most comprehensive description of data. Unlike traditional statistical hypothesis tests, which focus primarily on detecting differences, models emphasize estimation, making results more meaningful for patients and clinicians.\nOne major advantage of models is their ability to adjust for multiple factors simultaneously, providing more accurate effect estimates. While researchers often focus on multiplicity adjustments for p-values, they rarely apply similar adjustments to effect estimates. Models, however, allow for these adjustments because the effect of interest is fully conditional on covariate values. In other words, model-based methods are much more powerful and reliable than analyzing variables in isolation.\nFor instance, consider a scenario in kidney transplantation, where we want to assess the impact of the deceased donor’s age increasing from 50 to 65 while holding other risk factors constant. A simple subgroup comparison—such as analyzing younger versus older donors doesn’t provide a reasonable estimate of this specific effect. A model, however, allows us to quantify the risk associated with this change while controlling for other variables as well.\nModels also generalize statistical tests. For example, a t-test and ANOVA can be performed using multiple linear regression. Similarly, the Wilcoxon test and Kruskal-Wallis test correspond to a proportional odds model, while the log-rank test is a special case of the Cox proportional hazards model.\nUltimately, a model-based approach is the most accurate description of your data. However, it cannot definitively establish causality without careful attention to the research question, causal estimand, study design, and underlying assumptions [9].\nIn the end, you have the choice: get confused by analyzing variables individually or let a statistical model confuse you all at once.\nThe title of this post is a song by Genesis; the preview image of this post is a photo by Katie Moum on Unsplash."

    "text": "Just one more thing\nI performed a simulation study with an example from the heart transplant waiting list. Again, this is not real data; I made this up. All data were generated from the following assumptions.\n\nI generated data for 2,000 patients\n25% were female (500 patients) and 75% were male (1500 patients)\nFemales had an average weight of 65 kg with a standard deviation of 10 kg\nMales had an average weight of 80 kg with a standard deviation of 10 kg\n\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(2025)\n\n# Install the swt package\n# remotes::install_github(\"Swisstransplant/swt\")\nlibrary(swt)\nlibrary(rms)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nN = 2000\nn1 = 0.25*N # female \nn2 = 0.75*N # male\n\nheart = data.frame(weight = rep(NA, N),\n                   sex = c(rep(\"female\", n1), rep(\"male\", n2))\n)\n\nheart$weight[heart$sex == \"female\"] = rnorm(n1, mean = 65, sd = 10)\nheart$weight[heart$sex == \"male\"] = rnorm(n2, mean = 80, sd = 10)\n\n\nNext, I generated the probabilities for a heart transplant as an inverse function of body weight. As body weight increases, the likelihood of receiving a matching heart transplant decreases. Research supports this inverse relationship between body weight and transplant probability: larger individuals require greater cardiac output, and a smaller donor heart may struggle to meet these demands, potentially leading to poor circulation and organ failure [10].\nI sampled from a binomial distribution to determine whether each patient received a transplant or not based on their individual probability. In my simulation, the probability of a transplant depended solely on body weight and not on sex. Precisely, the probability was constant at 0.80 until 65 kg; then it decreased as a quadratic function.\n\n\nCode\n# function with constant prob until 65, then declines\nprob_fun &lt;- function(x) {\n  prob = ifelse(x &lt;= 65, 0.8, 0.8 - (x - 65)^2 / 2200)\n  return(pmax(prob, 0))  \n}\n\nheart$P = sapply(heart$weight, FUN = prob_fun)\nheart$P = heart$P + rnorm(N, 0, sd = 0.1) # add some noise\nheart$P[heart$P &gt; 1] = 1 # truncate probabilities\nheart$P[heart$P &lt; 0] = 0\n\nheart$event = rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = heart$P)\nheart$event = heart$event == 1 # binary conversion\n\n\nThe simulated data for 10 randomly picked patients are shown in Table 1.

Among females, about 77% received a transplant, compared to 66% of males.\n\nTesting is futile\nI tested whether sex was independent of a heart transplant using Pearson’s \\(\\chi^2\\)-test for count data. I knew this was a bad idea, but since looking at variables individually is common in medical research, doing it one more time didn’t hurt.\n\n\nCode\nM = table(heart$event, heart$sex)\nnontpx.fmt = sprintf(\"%d (%.1f)\", M[1,], M[1,]/marginSums(M, margin = 2)*100)\ntpx.fmt    = sprintf(\"%d (%.1f)\", M[2,], M[2,]/marginSums(M, margin = 2)*100)\ntab.fmt = rbind(nontpx.fmt, tpx.fmt)\ntab = as.data.frame(tab.fmt)\nrownames(tab) = c(\"no transplant\", \"transplant\")\ncolnames(tab) = c(\"female\", \"male\")\ntab\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Contingency table with counts (%) showing the relationship between sex and heart transplant status.\n\n\n\nfemale\nmale\n\n\n\n\nno transplant\n116 (23.2)\n510 (34.0)\n\n\ntransplant\n384 (76.8)\n990 (66.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nstats = chisq.test(M, correct = FALSE)\n\n\nI found that more females received a transplant than expected (384 versus 343.5), while fewer males received a transplant than expected (990 versus 1030.5). This provided strong evidence that sex was related to receiving a heart transplant (p &lt; 0.001).\nBut what was the issue? This simple analysis failed to capture the whole picture. Weight was related to both sex and the likelihood of receiving a heart transplant (Figure 2). Females typically have lower body weight, and heavier individuals are less likely to receive a heart transplant. Therefore, the body weight acts as a confounder. If I were unaware of body weight, I might incorrectly conclude that being female increases the likelihood of receiving a heart transplant. However, this was not the case and would only mislead us, as a heavy female would have a low chance of a transplant, while a lightweight male would have a higher chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(Sex) --&gt; B(Likelihood of a heart transplant)\n  A &lt;--&gt; C(Body weight)\n  C --&gt; B\n\n\n Figure 2: Body weight is a confounder variable as it is associated with sex and also impacts the outcome of a heart transplant. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s a model!\nNext, I analyzed the data all at once using a logistic regression model. The results are shown in Table 4.

Increasing weight from 68 kg to 84 kg was associated with roughly a 50% reduction in the chance of a heart transplant. No evidence was found for sex.\n\n\nSo what?\nA model is often the best description of the data. Regression models are part of university-level statistics courses across life sciences. Thus, there is really no excuse for testing variables individually instead of using a statistical model."

I reported to a manager and had deliverables, and I taught myself the command language Bash from reading Newham & Rosenblatt [1]. The things I learned back then still largely influence my daily interactions with computers today, which is by using a Unix type of shell program.\nDuring my internship, I bought an IBM ThinkCentre S50.

    "text": "Computer age\nIt was 2024, a rainy day in October. I went to the basement to get rid of old stuff. I found my old IBM ThinkCentre S50 from 2004. It was still there.\nWhat could you do with a 20-year-old computer in 2024? Not much, I guessed. The plan was to install a lightweight Linux distribution and the latest R, RStudio, and Quarto.\nI also found a M52 in my basement, which was a slightly newer model from 2005. The two models, the S50 and the M52, were very similar; in fact, both had a Pentium 4 3.0 GHz processor and 1GB of memory. However, the S50 was the Intel Northwood architecture (32-bit), while the M52 was the Prescott architecture (64-bit). I didn’t want to install a 32-bit (i386) operating system. Major Linux distributions have dropped i386 support, for example, Ubuntu in 2019.\nThus, I decided to go for the M52; however, the S50 had a floppy drive. It would be a real shame to make a compromise here. Fortunately, the M52 had a tray for the floppy drive and a connector on the main board. I just had to install the floppy drive and replace the M52 front bezel with the one from the S50 because of the opening for the floppy drive.\nThe result was an M52 with the look of an S50, brilliant; see a photo in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: IBM ThinkCentre M52 with S50 front bezel and floppy drive.\n\n\nI spent a little money to upgrade the machine from 1GB memory to 4GB memory (purchased online; CHF 7.50). I also replaced the hard disk, which was an HDD, with a modern SSD that I had as a spare. Then I installed Lubuntu 24.04 LTS, a lightweight Linux based on Ubuntu, R 4.4.1, and the latest version of RStudio and Quarto.\nI collected some system information using the system() function which called neofetch from within this Quarto Blog post, see Table 1. Exactly, I wrote this blog post using the old IBM computer.\n\n\nCode\ninfo = system(\"neofetch --stdout\", intern = TRUE)\nidx = c(4, 15, 17, 16, 3, 5) # select items to show\ninfo = strsplit(info, \": \")\ntab = do.call(\"rbind\", info[idx])\ntab = as.data.frame(tab)\ncolnames(tab) = c(\"Type\", \"System Information\")\ntab\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: System information that was directly collected while this Quarto blog post was rendered on my almost 20-year-old IBM machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nSystem Information\n\n\n\n\nHost\n8215Y6G ThinkCentre M52\n\n\nCPU\nIntel Pentium 4 3.00GHz (2) @ 1.500GHz\n\n\nMemory\n1540MiB / 3222MiB\n\n\nGPU\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 610\n\n\nOS\nLubuntu 24.04.1 LTS x86_64\n\n\nKernel\n6.8.0-48-generic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI wondered why I only had 3GB of memory available, even though I installed 4GB. Looking at the technical specifications of the M53, I found the following line:\n\nIf 4GB of physical memory is installed approximately 3GB will be useable by the operating system. This is due to limitations from the address mapping of PCI busses and other system devices.\n\nWell, that was a shame, but okay, at least there was nothing wrong on my side."

The odds for a 1st class passenger to survive were about 9.7 times higher, and for a 2nd class passenger, about 2.8 times higher compared to a 3rd class passenger. Age also had an effect; the older the person, the less likely they survived. For example, the odds for a 39-year-old person to survive were only about 0.5 times compared to a younger 21-year-old.\n\nSo what?\nIf you were male, 3rd class, or old, you were more likely to die in the Titanic incident. However, this was only a quick showcase rather than an in-depth analysis of the Titanic data, and the large amount of missing data was not ideal. But I wanted to say something else.\nI wanted to say, don’t throw away old computers. They can still be fun."

If we don’t believe in science, what should we believe in? However, scientific findings are sometimes based on weak statistical results. I will focus on the widespread misunderstanding of the p-value.\nI would say it slightly differently. The vast majority of data analysis is performed by people who are not properly trained. Therefore, p-values are indeed used poorly as a consequence.\nThe poor understanding and misuse of p-values caused the American Statistical Association (ASA) to release a statement in 2016 [1]. The ASA argued that the p-values are commonly misinterpreted. Many researchers believe a low p-value is some form of insurance that the result or study is credible and worth publishing. A scientific result is worth publishing when the study was well planned, designed, conducted, and reported. A study protocol with a statistical analysis plan can help with this. The p-value in itself does not matter at all. In a perfect world, we see mostly high-quality studies with both low and high p-values. The opposite is true; there are too many low-quality studies, and too many studies report exclusively low p-values."

    "text": "What does the p-value actually mean?\nThe p-value is a measure of how compatible the data are with a specified model. This model is under the null hypothesis, which often says that there is no difference between two groups or there is an absence of a relationship between a variable and an outcome. The smaller the p-value, the greater this incompatibility of the data with the null hypothesis. Thus, a small p-value may then provide evidence against the null hypothesis.\nHere is how the ASA explained the p-value:\n\nInformally, a p-value is the probability under a specified statistical model that a statistical summary of the data (e.g., the sample mean difference between two compared groups) would be equal to or more extreme than its observed value. —ASA Statment\n\nIn other words, it is a probability statement about the data and not about the truth of a hypothesis. The most common misunderstanding is that a p-value of 0.012 reflects a 1.2% probability that the null hypothesis is true or that the data were produced by coincidence. These interpretations are not correct. Most researchers may not be aware that the commonly used alpha level of 5% is absolutely no guarantee that the result is not a fluke. In fact, p-values, the alleged gold standard of statistical validity, are not as reliable as many researchers believe [2]."

    "section": "A lot of science may be wrong",
    "text": "A lot of science may be wrong\nWhen looking at the body of, for example, medical research, I wonder, how many results are really true? How many results are not? Unfortunately, the answer may not be very amusing [3–5].\nTo get an approximate answer for a specific situation, I considered 1,000 studies; each was well-designed and conducted. I assumed the widely used alpha level was 5%, meaning that in 5 of 100 studies where there was no effect, I found a positive result. This is known as the type I error. Furthermore, I assumed all the studies had a statistical power of 80%. Thus, among the studies where there really was a true effect, I would find it in 80 of 100 studies. Consequently, in 20 out of 100 studies, however, I would miss the true result. These were the false negatives, also known as the type II error. My last assumption was about the question, how many hypotheses were really true? I assumed a study area where a good number of hypotheses turned out to be true, say, 3 in 10.\nImagine 1,000 hypotheses under investigation, where 3 in 10 were true. Thus, 300 were true, and 700 were false. Of the 700 false hypotheses, I found 5% to be falsely positive, which was 35. From the 300 true hypotheses, I found a positive result in 80% of the cases, which were 240. Altogether, I saw 35 and 240 results as positive results; however, 35 were false, which was 13%.\nI used the common alpha level of 5%, but 13% of the results were wrong. This really is the best-case scenario with an alpha level of 5% and a statistical power of 80%. The reality is much worse.\nIn reality, the reported standard errors and p-values are often biased. The reason is that data is often reanalyzed until the desired result was obtained. Thus, many reported results probably have a much higher p-value than if data were analyzed according to a prespecified protocol. The 5% alpha level is maybe 10% or higher. Furthermore, the statistical power of 80% is from a perfect world, and this assumption is not realistic at all, even in the domain of the highest standards, such as clinical trials [6]. I don’t know what the true statistical power might be; maybe it is as low as 50%. Lastly, there are domains where true hypotheses are not so prevalent, for example, where only 1 in 10 hypotheses are, in fact, true.\nMaking a scientific claim in a domain where novel findings are hard to discover, where p-hacking is prevalent, and where sample size calculations and statistical power are dismissed makes a result very unlikely to be true, even if the p-value is statistically significant.\nWhen I look at a p-value, I don’t see it solely in terms of whether it is statistically significant. I put it in some context and ask myself, can I believe a finding when taking other information into the equation, for example, the study design, the sample size, the statistical analysis, and how results have been reported? If I had no skepticism and just looked at the magnitude of a p-value, ignoring everything else, I might just as well believe in Santa Claus.\nOr let me take a better example. Ignoring the story behind a p-value and taking it at face value would be like waking up one morning with a headache and concluding that you have a rare brain tumor [2].\nA brain tumor may be possible but very unlikely. So are the results of many scientific discoveries.\nThe title of this post is a song by Cindy Lauper. The preview image of this post is a photo by Drew Beamer on Unsplash."

In these plots, each square was a hypothesis that was either true or false. Each hypothesis was tested by a study.

Given an alpha level of 0.05, there were 35 studies that produced a false positive result (type I error). The studies also had a power of 80%; thus, 60 of the studies were false negatives (type II error), see Figure 2.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(mylist$data, aes(x=col, y=row, fill=H_)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"grey90\") +\n  coord_equal() +\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = COLORS, guide = guide_none())\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Visualization of studies that tested 1,000 hypotheses. Some studies produced a false positive result among the false hypotheses (light green). Some studies produced a false negative result among the true hypotheses (light red).\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, we see positive results, and we don’t know which are false. There were 240 positive results (green) and 35 false positive results (light green). The proportion of false positive results among all the positive results was 0.13; this is also known as the false discovery rate (FDR). Note that this error rate is more than double as high as the convenient alpha level of 0.05.\nHowever, the assumptions above really came from a perfect world. I then used a more realistic setting, for example, assuming a scientific field where 1 in 10 hypotheses was true, with an alpha level of 0.10 and a statistical power of 50%.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(2024)\nmylist = true_colors(k = k, p_true = 0.10, alpha = 0.10, power = 0.50)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(mylist$data, aes(x=col, y=row, fill=H_)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"grey90\") +\n  coord_equal() +\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = COLORS, guide = guide_none())\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Visualization of studies that tested 1,000 hypotheses. Some studies produced a false positive result among the false hypotheses (light green). Some studies produced a false negative result among the true hypotheses (light red).\n\n\n\n\nIn such a scenario, there were 50 positive results (green) and 90 false positive results (light green). Thus, 64% of all positive results were wrong. That was more than half of all the studies.\n\nSo what?\nMany research results may be wrong. Only trust studies that were well designed, conducted, analyzed, and reported. Don’t take the p-value as a measure of credibility or importance of a result. By the way, the reader can use the function true_colors() to try out different scenarios."

All in all, it is a bit of a mystery.\nFor some researchers, statistics is also a bit of a mystery. In 2018, a study titled “Regulation of REM and Non-REM Sleep by Periaqueductal GABAergic Neurons” was published in Nature Communications led by researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, and the University of Pennsylvania [1]. The study investigated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in mice, which is a sleep phase characterized by vivid dreams and random movement of the eyes.\nThe only thing I know about R.E.M. is that it is also the name of a pretty good rock band; I grew up listening to their music. The very first album I bought as a kid was The Best of R.E.M. from 1991. For me, rock music and statistics go hand in hand, just like in Andy Field’s book Discovering Statistics Using R [2]. But now, let’s get back to our sleep study.\nThe good news is that we don’t need to understand anything about REM sleep, the brain, or the mouse. I probably don’t even know the difference between a mouse, a rat, and a hamster. The subject matter would only distract us. Let’s ignore everything in this paper except a tiny bit from the methods section.\nHave you ever read just one sentence from a research study? It can be enough to make a case.\nBut first, let me say something else. In some prestigious journals, the methods and statistics section, the most relevant part for judging the validity and credibility of a study, is literally the small print at the end. This reminds me of what I wrote last time, that statistics is largely undervalued. Does anyone read that part?\nWell, I do."

    "text": "Peeping Tom\nDuring my time at the University of Warwick in Coventry, I learned about the legend of “Peeping Tom.” In my version, however, Peeping Tom was a scientist obsessed with observing the p-value. The scientist would always take a glimpse at that darn p-value and how it changed over the course of the experiment as more data was added. In the end, the scientist was struck blind—end of the story.\nLooking at the data again and again (and again) as more data are added and a statistical test is run each time, it is essentially a multiple-testing situation that would require some form of adjustment of the p-value. The reason is that this (bad) research practice considerably increases the chance that a statistically significant finding is a fluke.\nMoreover, the study authors failed to report the non-significant results from all the statistical tests they conducted. They continued testing until they found a significant result, which they then reported. This selective reporting, based on the significance of the test, skews the interpretation of their findings. Despite the ongoing debate about when to adjust p-values, the situation here clearly calls for a “haircut” to their p-values [3].\nIn the Seven Sins in statistical significance testing [4], the practice of repeatedly looking at the p-value is described as the sin number three, the repeated inspection of data.\nThe solution to this problem is simple. It can be avoided by not analyzing the data until the study is completed and the planned sample size is reached. But I’m not sure that sample size is often planned in animal research."

I was shortlisted for the second round, and after my presentation, a member of the committee asked me why I would not do my own MRI experiment to collect my own data. I replied that I did not want to do another N = 30 MRI study. The person replied that there were studies published in the journal Nature with only 7 mice. I had to laugh because I thought it was a joke, but nobody else was laughing.\nWell, here we are, years later, thinking more deeply about this. In the present study, the sample size was not 7 mice. It was 12 mice, to be fair.\n\n\n\nAndy Warhol, Myths: Mickey Mouse from 1981 (Halcyon Gallery)\n\n\nIn 2011, two comments about preclinical cancer research raised eyebrows [5,6]. Apparently, several landmark studies in high-impact journals that generated hundreds of secondary publications could not be verified by the pharmaceutical companies Bayer and Amgen. In these studies, investigators sometimes reported a single finding that supported their hypothesis, but it was often cherry-picked. This was the starting point for Tim Errington’s investigation of reproducibility in preclinical cancer research [7]. Reasons for irreproducibility in preclinical animal studies can include small sample sizes and thus low statistical power, as well as over-standardization of experiments [8]. After reading all all this, I’m not so surprised when another lab can’t confirm an exciting study finding from an animal experiment in a prestigious journal.\nIf a result cannot be repeated, what is it worth?\nReproducible animal studies require transparent reporting. The ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines were initially developed in 2010 to improve the reporting of animal research, and version 2.0 was published in 2020 [9]."

    "text": "An exception to the rule\nThere are some exceptions where stopping a study early may be justified. But that’s a whole different ballgame. Such situations need to be predefined, and adequate statistical methods need to be used in the analysis. In clinical trials there is the term “interim analysis”, where an analysis is conducted before the end of the study and data collection. This can be very useful when a treatment is clearly beneficial or harmful compared to the control arm [10]. Then, the investigator can stop the study early. However, as I said, this is all very well planned and defined a priori in a study protocol and statistical analysis plan.\nFor example, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) was a four-arm trial of three antiarrhythmic drugs versus placebo on the risk of sudden cardiac death [11]. Early in the CAST study, two arms (encainide and flecainide) were stopped because of excess mortality compared with the placebo arm.\nIn the present mouse study, however, the authors stopped the experiment because the p-value fell below the magical level of \\(p \\le 0.05\\), which apparently signaled to them that they could publish their results and didn’t need to kill any more mice. If you do enough tests, you will always obtain a p-value less than the magical threshold.\n\nI’m looking for an interruption. Do you believe? —I don’t sleep, I dream (song by R.E.M.)\n\nI don’t believe in stopping this study early, and I don’t trust the results. However, I believe that the authors of the study did not want to cheat. They probably didn’t know any better. They thought the approach was okay, so they wrote it in the methods section. No statistician was on the list of authors, I guess, and no statistician reviewed the paper.\nOne last thought. When the authors of the study stopped the experiment, it was good for the next mouse whose life was saved. Unless the study was flawed.\nThen all those mice would have been wasted.\nThe title of this post is a song by R.E.M.; the preview image of this post is a photo by Karsten Winegeart on Unsplash."

I assumed that the planned sample size was \\(N = 30\\) animals. However, I peeped at the data already after testing 10 animals and then repeated the test after each additional animal until \\(p \\leq 0.05\\) or the total sample size was reached. Since no animals were harmed in my experiment, I performed \\(k = 10000\\) of such studies.\nIn the mouse study, two measurements were obtained for each mouse. I sampled both observations from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Thus, the model behind the simulation assumed that there was no difference between the mice before and after exposure. Thus, any result I found was a fluke.\nI performed the same test reported in the paper, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, but that doesn’t really matter for making the case. You could make the case with any statistical significance test that successfully controls the type I error at 5% (falsely rejecting the null).\nIn total, I collected \\(21 \\times 10^{4}\\) p-values (21 repeated inspections and 10000 studies).\n\n\nCode\nFP = sum(ps[,ncol(ps)] &lt;= 0.05)\n\n\nI looked at the last p-value for each study, i.e., after data from the total of \\(N = 30\\) animals had been collected. I found that 452 out of 10000 studies were statistically significant, which is a type I error rate of 0.045. Thank God, the error was under control. So far, so good.\n\n\nCode\n# function peep() to get p value using repeated inspection\npeep &lt;- function(x) {\n  \n  d = data.frame(t = NA, p = NA)\n  \n  # pick first p value that is below cutoff\n  if (min(x) &lt;= 0.05) {\n    i = which(x &lt;= 0.05)[1] # pick first p value that is below cutoff\n    d$t = i\n    d$p = x[i]\n    \n    # if no success pick last p value\n  } else {\n    d$t = length(x)\n    d$p = x[length(x)]\n  }\n  \n  return(d)\n}\n\nmyp = apply(ps, 1, peep)\nmyp = as.data.frame(t(array(unlist(myp), dim = c(2, k))))\ncolnames(myp) = c(\"t\", \"p\")\n\n\nNow, the twist. I peeped at the other p-values. I picked the p-value as soon as it turned statistically significant and stopped the experiment. But when I was not lucky enough to observe a \\(p \\leq 0.05\\), I picked the p-value from the last repeated test with \\(N = 30\\) animals, whatever that value looked like.\n\n\nCode\nFP = sum(myp$p &lt;= 0.05)\n\n\nI found that 1637 out of 10000 studies were statistically significant, which was a type I error rate of 0.16. Now, we have lost control. The type I error of falsely rejecting the null has tripled.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\nN_plots = 2\n\n# pick two significant studies\nset.seed(2024)\nidx = which(myp$p &lt;= 0.05)\nidx = sample(idx, N_plots)\n\np = list()\n\nfor (i in 1:N_plots) {\n  \n  d = data.frame(p = ps[idx[i],], stop = stop)\n  \n  p[[i]] = ggplot(d, aes(x = stop, y = p, col = \"red\")) + \n    geom_line() + \n    geom_point(size = 2) +\n    geom_point(data = myp[idx[i],], \n               size = 2,\n               mapping = aes(x = t + stop[1] - 1,\n                             y = p, col=\"green\")) +\n    ylim(c(0, 1)) +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.05) +\n    scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#BF505A\", \"#6F87A6\")) +\n    labs(title = paste(\"Study\", i), tag = LETTERS[i]) +\n    xlab(\"Number of mice observed\") + ylab(\"p-value\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n}\n\ndo.call(\"grid.arrange\", c(p, nrow = 1, ncol=2))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Two example studies that were stopped early due to peeping at the p-value before the study was completed. The red data point highlights the statistically significant p-value at which the study was stopped early. In (A), the study was stopped after observing 10 mice and (B) after observing 25 mice. The horizontal line shows the significance level of 0.05. As we can see, the p-value is very wiggly and can be exploited by bad research practices such as the repeated inspection of data.\n\n\n\n\nTwo case studies from the 1637 positive findings that were statistically significant by peeping are shown in Figure 1. Study 1 was statistically significant at the first glimpse, so we could already go home after 10 mice. Brilliant. Study 2 was statistically significant after 25 mice. Looking only at the last p-value, after the 30 mice, then both Study 1 and Study 2 were not statistically significant. This result would be correct since I was the creator of the data and knew the truth behind the data.\nThe truth was that there was nothing there.\n\nSo what?\nFirst, a p-value from repeated inspection of data is nothing more than a fluke of the universe. Don’t trust it. Second, Nature Communications might consider involving expert statisticians in the evaluation of a study. After all, their article processing fee is 6790 US dollars."
