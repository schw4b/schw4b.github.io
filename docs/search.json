Competing risk multistate models are suited for the analysis of time-to-event data of the organ waiting list. Resulting cumulative incidences are probabilities for transplantation or death by a given time and are a more accurate description of the events occurring on the waiting list. In accordance with the concept of median survival time in survival analysis in clinical trials, we can derive the median time to transplantation (MTT), the waiting time duration at which the transplant probability is 0.50.\n\n\n\nFigure: Cumulative incidence curves for transplantation for the different organs A—E with 95% confidence bands and median time to transplantation (MTT) defined as the duration corresponding to the cumulative incidence of 0.50 (dashed line).\n\n\n\nPublications\nSchwab S, Elmer A, Sidler D, Straumann L, Stuerzinger U, Immer F.

Previous research criticized the quality of prediction models concerning poor reporting and the risk of bias. How this applies to prediction models in organ donation and transplantation needs to be clarified. Therefore, this scoping review aims to assess prediction models used in transplant centers in Switzerland and update clinicians on the transparency, quality of reporting, and risk of bias of these tools.\n\n\n\nFigure: To transplant or not to transplant?
