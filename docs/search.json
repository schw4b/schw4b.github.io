    "text": "Where, oh, where would we researchers be without statistics? It enables us to analyze and report our study findings. Statistics add meaning to the data, creating information and value. Without statistics, data have only minimal meaning.\nMy view is that all data are rubbish without proper statistics. Nevertheless, the glorification of data has evolved over the last decades and continues to do so. An example is the front cover of the magazine Science from 2011. It is a collage of words, but only one stands out in large letters: “data.”\nWe are indeed very hungry for data. However, I don’t believe data should take center stage. What is more important is how we perform statistics on the data.\nI tried to find the word “statistics” on the Science front cover but could not find it. Can you see it? Maybe the word “data” should be a bit smaller to leave more room for the word “statistics,” the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.\nNevertheless, many medical studies are conducted with little or no involvement of adequately trained statisticians, and the same is true for scientific peer review [1]. Many researchers don’t use statistics properly. They might not know enough about it, or they might ignore expert advice. Statisticians are often only involved at the end of a study to analyze the data despite being specialists in helping researchers clarify the question and designing the study from scratch. Often, research projects do not include enough funding for statistical work.\nIt sounds absurd, but data is largely overvalued these days, and statistics is largely undervalued."

I assumed the three prognostic variables (\\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\)) were uncorrelated and related to the outcome using an additive model. The true effects were \\(\\beta_1 = 0.5\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 0.3\\), and \\(\\beta_3 = 0.2\\). For the unrelated variable \\(x_4\\), we had \\(\\beta_4 = 0\\). I added some noise so that the explained variance was about 20% (\\(R^2\\)). Below are the results, see Table 1.\n\n\nCode\nd = data.frame(y = y, x1 = data[,1], x2 = data[,2], x3 = data[,3], x4 = data[,4])\nfit = lm(y ~ ., data = d)\ntidy_lm(fit)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Results from a regression model fitted with long data using simulated data from N=2000 patients.\n\n\n\nEffect estimate\n95% CI\np-value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.00\nfrom -0.05 to 0.06\n0.96\n\n\nx1\n0.49\nfrom 0.43 to 0.54\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx2\n0.31\nfrom 0.25 to 0.37\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx3\n0.23\nfrom 0.17 to 0.29\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx4\n-0.01\nfrom -0.07 to 0.04\n0.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe p-values for the first three variables were statistically significant. This basically means that the data were very incompatible with our null model that the true effects were zero (my lawyers helped me with the wording of this sentence). For \\(x_4\\), the p-value was statistically non-significant. But this is all not really interesting, is it? And I don’t particularly like to focus on the results in terms of statistical significance.\nMuch more interesting than the p-values were the effect estimates. Since I was the creator of the data, I could see that the estimates were close to the true effects, but not exactly. For the effect estimates to match the true effects even better, we would need even more data (tens of thousands of patients). But I think it was quite acceptable."

However, I did not increase the sample size in terms of the number of patients. Instead, I created data with \\(q = 4000\\) biomarkers (high-dimensional data). Since these may be expensive and complex measurements, I decreased the sample size to \\(N = 200\\). For each biomarker, I estimated a univariable model and used a cutoff of \\(p \\le 0.05\\) for screening (univariable screening). I know it is a really bad idea, but since so many papers have done it, it shouldn’t hurt anyone to do it just one more time.\nLet’s now pretend we knew that \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\) were the relevant biomarkers. The regression results from the same model as above (\\(x_1\\) to \\(x_4\\)) are shown below in Table 2.\n\n\nCode\nd = data.frame (y = y, x1 = data[,1], x2 = data[,2], x3 = data[,3], x4 = data[,4])\nfit = lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4, data = d)\ntidy_lm(fit)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Results from a regression model fitted with wide data using simulated data form N=200 patients.\n\n\n\nEffect estimate\n95% CI\np-value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.05\nfrom -0.21 to 0.12\n0.58\n\n\nx1\n0.47\nfrom 0.31 to 0.63\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx2\n0.20\nfrom 0.02 to 0.38\n0.026 *\n\n\nx3\n0.24\nfrom 0.07 to 0.41\n0.005 **\n\n\nx4\n0.07\nfrom -0.10 to 0.24\n0.41\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effect estimates were more off from the truth, particularly \\(x_2\\), and the confidence intervals were much wider. This was not surprising as the sample size was only \\(N = 200\\). All in all, we are much more uncertain; though, the p-values for \\(x_1\\) to \\(x_3\\) were still statistically significant. However, the larger uncertainty was not the main problem.\n\n\nCode\nk = sum(pvalues  &lt;= 0.05)\npvalues.adj = p.adjust(pvalues, method = \"fdr\")\nk.adj = sum(pvalues.adj  &lt;= 0.05)\n\n\nThe main problem was we didn’t know that \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\) were the relevant biomarkers. Using univariable screening, with \\(p \\le 0.05\\) for variable selection, a striking 214 out of a total of 4000 variables were statistically significant; this matches up with the alpha level of 5%.\nI tried to adjust the p-values to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at 5% using the Benjamini & Hochberg procedure; however, only \\(x_1\\) remained statistically significant. So, this only partially helped. I wanted more specificity, and I had to pay with sensitivity. It seems to be really difficult to get the correct model with such a large data set. It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack.\nIn the final step, perhaps out of desperation, I opted for a middle way: instead of using an unadjusted threshold of 5% or an FDR of 5%, I applied an unadjusted threshold of \\(p \\le 0.001\\). The results are shown in Table 3.\n\n\nCode\nidx = which(pvalues &lt;= 0.001) # select variables with arbitrary threshold\nd = data.frame(y = y, x = data[, idx]) \nfit = lm(y ~ ., data = d)\ntab = tidy_lm(fit)\n# add variable names\nrownames(tab)[2:(length(idx) + 1)] = paste0(\"x\", idx)\ntab\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Results from a regression model fitted with wide data and using univariable screening to find relevant biomarkers.\n\n\n\nEffect estimate\n95% CI\np-value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.01\nfrom -0.17 to 0.14\n0.86\n\n\nx1\n0.36\nfrom 0.20 to 0.51\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx602\n-0.34\nfrom -0.50 to -0.17\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx971\n0.19\nfrom 0.03 to 0.35\n0.017 *\n\n\nx2186\n0.28\nfrom 0.12 to 0.45\n&lt; 0.001 ***\n\n\nx3748\n0.14\nfrom -0.01 to 0.30\n0.073 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this step, we have left the realm of science facts and entered the realm of science fiction. The results above show voodoo statistics with statistically significant results for the variables that are pure noise (except \\(x_1\\)). The model explained 28% of the variance (adj. \\(R^2\\)).\nI think I tortured the data too much. Surely, a journal would publish such statistically significant results!"

Certainly, there are situations where the problem is not so extreme, but there may be situations where the issue is even more extreme. It is almost impossible to find the relevant “truths” in the data when trying too many different things (the garden of forking paths).\nYou may object that the simulations I made were too pessimistic. Yes, but we often don’t know how good the signal-to-noise ratio is in clinical data. And completely in the dark, we must be very careful in the process of analyzing high-dimensional data, particularly when we use model selection. Univariable screening is well-known for providing flawed results, but it is still widely used today (or widely misused, I should say).\nThe process of how the result was obtained is much more important than the result itself.\nFor further reading, see “How to Do Bad Biomarker Research” by Frank Harrell [12].

    "text": "Sleep is fascinating. We all sleep at night, but we don’t really know what is happening during this period. Sometimes we dream, sometimes we don’t. All in all, it is a bit of a mystery.\nFor some researchers, statistics is also a bit of a mystery. In 2018, a study titled “Regulation of REM and Non-REM Sleep by Periaqueductal GABAergic Neurons” was published in Nature Communications led by researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, and the University of Pennsylvania [1]. The study investigated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in mice, which is a sleep phase characterized by vivid dreams and random movement of the eyes.\nThe only thing I know about R.E.M. is that it is also the name of a pretty good rock band; I grew up listening to their music. The very first album I bought as a kid was The Best of R.E.M. from 1991. For me, rock music and statistics go hand in hand, just like in Andy Field’s book Discovering Statistics Using R [2]. But now, let’s get back to our sleep study.\nThe good news is that we don’t need to understand anything about REM sleep, the brain, or the mouse. I probably don’t even know the difference between a mouse, a rat, and a hamster. The subject matter would only distract us. Let’s ignore everything in this paper except a tiny bit from the methods section.\nHave you ever read just one sentence from a research study? It can be enough to make a case.\nBut first, let me say something else. In some prestigious journals, the methods and statistics section, the most relevant part for judging the validity and credibility of a study, is literally the small print at the end. This reminds me of what I wrote last time, that statistics is largely undervalued. Does anyone read that part?\nWell, I do."

Therefore, this scoping review aims to assess prediction models used in transplant centers in Switzerland and update clinicians on the transparency, quality of reporting, and risk of bias of these tools.\n\n\n\nFigure: To transplant or not to transplant? Assessing the quality and limitations of existing prediction models can inform further research to develop novel or update existing models to improve the decision-making at transplant centers.\n\n\n\nResources\n\nStudy registration on OSF Registries from 6. April 2024"
