    "text": "Where, oh, where would we researchers be without statistics? It enables us to analyze and report our study findings. Statistics add meaning to the data, creating information and value. Without statistics, data have only minimal meaning.\n“You can be rich in data but poor in information.” —Stephen Senn\nPut bluntly, all data are rubbish without statistics. Nevertheless, the glorification of data has evolved dramatically over the last decade and continues to do so. An example is the front cover of the magazine Science from 2011. It is a collage of words, but only one stands out in large letters: “data.”\nWe are indeed very hungry for data. However, I don’t believe data should take center stage. What is more important is how we analyze and interpret data. In other words, it is all about how we perform statistics on the data.\nI tried to find the word “statistics” on the front cover but could not find it. Can you see it? Maybe Science should have made the word “data” a bit smaller to leave more room for the word “statistics,” the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.\nNevertheless, many medical studies are conducted with no or little involvement of adequately trained statisticians; and the same is true for scientific peer-review [1].\nIt seem that we live in a world where data is overvalued and statistics is undervalued.\n\n\n\nScience magazine front cover from 11. February 2011.\n\n\n\nBig data\nAnother example of the glorification of data is the term Big Data.\nWhat does big data even mean? I make the outrageous claim that big data is not the latest accomplishment of science in tackling unsolved problems. Instead, it is our defeat against data-hungry methods from machine learning, a hyped discipline also known as artificial intelligence or simply “AI.” Please make no mistake: 20,000 biomarkers for 100 patients is not big data; the sample size is still N=100, and I consider this a small study. For a prediction model for prognosis, for example, I would instead prefer 10 clinically relevant variables from 2,000 patients, even though this reflects only 1% of the data in the former example.\nToo much data can make data analysis harder, but this is often unrecognized. The unsystematic collection of high-dimensional data, when data is more “wide” than “long,” can lead to more questions than answers. For example, the failure of protein cancer biomarker research [2] or the Human Brain Project [3]. Maybe the combination of big data and overhyped promises is a reason for concern. I recognize this pattern of big data and exaggerated promises that are now being made in the field of AI in medicine.\nWhat I am trying to say is that data alone does not represent any real value, even if it is big data. Data can’t speak for themselves. Data is pretty dumb. Think about your favorite restaurant and your favorite dish. Imagine being served only unprepared food, raw and uncooked. That’s what data is basically without statistics; it’s just the ingredients, the parts. Data on their own are inedible food. And when you get plenty of it, it does not turn things for the better.\nOne may object that more data will always lead to less uncertainty. This is, in principle, true. However, then I imagine the many attempts very large datasets are being explored, analyzed, and reanalyzed until the the desired result is obtained, or until the model fits the data. Then, this process only appears to reduce the uncertainty.\nIt is called phantom degrees of freedom [4]. We have reduced uncertainty through a very well-fitting model, but this is an illusion because, in reality, the process by which the data were analyzed has increased uncertainty. The standard errors and p-values lie to us.\n\n\nBrave new tools\nStatistics summarize data into eatable bites. However, statistical data analysis is not easily prepared like a microwave-ready meal. It requires specialist work. And yes, mistakes can be made in this process [5]. Why can’t AI do all the difficult work for us?\nStatistic software from the past created the illusion that a nice graphical interface would empower those who wanted to explore statistics at the push of a button. The exact opposite has happened with the R programming language. I recently discovered a website with another attempt to make statistics easy: an AI-powered statistics tool.\n“It makes complex data analytics accessible to anyone, eliminating the need for advanced technical knowledge or expertise.” —Advertisement for an AI-based statistics tool\nHow does it work? You simply chat with your data files. For me, it sounds more like the production of flawed conclusions by untrained people via dangerous tools. That will be the gloomy future, it seems.\nThe production of science fiction as science facts.\nThe irony is that the tool was named after an assassinated Roman emperor. This is not a very good omen for the tool. Maybe we are all going to be very disappointed with AI doing our statistical analyses.\nMaybe, just maybe, AI sucks at being a personal statistical assistant. Maybe AI is much better at misusing statistics. The perfect p-hacking machine. AI is misused in many ways to produce fake images, fake texts, fake human voices, and fake videos. Why not fake statistics? AI confuses the real with the unreal, and why can’t this also be applied to data? The perfect tool for data fabrication in the future: a new weapon of math destruction [6]?\nI think we will need more people like Elisabeth Bik [7].\n\n\nWhat lies ahead of us?\nNowadays, AI and machine learning are heavily promoted to “revolutionize healthcare”; this seems an overhyped claim given the notorious overfitting of data in the field [8]. To be fair, it is not just AI that baffles me. Recently, 246 biologists obtained different results from the same data [9] or the latest blunder in functional MRI research [10]. This all demonstrates that we researchers seem to learn a lot from the noise in the data.\nFor now, I want to say that whenever there is a novel, exciting claim, my first reaction is often very reserved. I usually don’t believe it when I see some red flags.\nNow, are you ready for what is next? A world where the relentless rush of technology blurs the lines between what’s real and what’s not?\nFake plastic trees?\n\n\nJust one more thing\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(2024)\n\nSNR = 0.65 # corresponds to 20% explained variance r^2\nN = 2000 # number of patients\nq = 3 # number of biomarkers\n\n# generate data for a study\ndata = array(rnorm(N*q), dim = c(N, q))\nnoise = rnorm(N) # generate standard normal errors\ny = 0.5*data[,1] + 0.3*data[,2] + 0.2*data[,3] + 1/sqrt(SNR)*noise \n\nd = data.frame (y = y, x1 = data[,1], x2 = data[,2], x3 = data[,3])\nfit = lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = d)\nsummary(fit)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = d)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.3870 -0.8567 -0.0304  0.8180  4.1861 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.
