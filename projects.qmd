## 1. KIDMO---Kidney prediction model

KIDMO is a clinical prediction model for the prognosis in kidney transplant recipients at the time of organ offer. It will support decision-making to better understand donor, recipient and transplant-related risks. The model is currently developed with data from over 2'000 kidney transplant recipients.

## 3. WAIT---Waiting list analysis in transplantation

Median waiting times published by transplant organizations around the world may be biased when death or censoring is disregarded. Competing risk multistate models are suited for the analysis of time-to-event data of the organ waiting list. Resulting cumulative incidences are probabilities for transplantation or death by a given time, and are a more accurate description of the events occurring on the waiting list. In accordance with the concept of median survival time in survival analysis in clinical trials, we can derive the median time to transplantation (MTT) , the waiting time duration at which the transplant probability is 0.50.
