## 1. KIDMO---Kidney prediction model

KIDMO is a clinical prediction model for the prognosis in kidney transplant recipients at the time of organ offer. It will support decision-making to better understand donor, recipient and transplant-related risks. The model is currently developed with data from over 2'000 kidney transplant recipients.
