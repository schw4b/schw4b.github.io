## Kidney prediction model (KIDMO)

KIDMO is a clinical prediction model for the prognosis in kidney-transplanted patients. The model is currently developed with data from over 2'000 kidney transplant recipients. More information can be found here:

## Ex vivo allograft monitoring (EXAM)

EXAM is an analytics dashboard for ex vivo allograft monitoring during hypothermic machine perfusion in deceased-donor kidney transplantation.
