Below are showcases of my research projects, which include links to publications, study protocols, and presentations (talks, posters).

## 1. KIDMO---Kidney prediction model

KIDMO is a clinical prediction model for the prognosis in kidney transplant recipients at the time of organ offer. It will support decision-making to better understand donor, recipient, and transplant-related risks. The model is currently developed with data from over 2,000 kidney transplant recipients.

## 2. EXAM---Ex vivo allograft monitoring

EXAM is an analytics dashboard for analyzing hypothermic machine perfusion data in deceased-donor kidney transplantation.

## 3. WAIT---Waitlist analysis in transplantation

Median organ waiting times published by transplant organizations may be biased when not appropriately accounting for censoring, death, and competing events. This can lead to overly optimistic waiting times for all transplant programs and, consequently, may deceive patients on the waiting list, transplant physicians, and health care policymakers. This study applyied competing-risk multistate models to calculate probabilities for transplantation and adverse outcomes on the Swiss national transplant waiting list.

## 4. REPORT---Reporting and evaluation of prediction models in organ transplantation

Clinical prediction models for prognosis can predict outcomes and support decision-making. Previous research criticized the quality of prediction models concerning poor reporting and the risk of bias. How this applies to prediction models in organ donation and transplantation needs to be clarified. Therefore, this scoping review aims to assess prediction models used in transplant centers in Switzerland and update clinicians on the transparency, quality of reporting, and risk of bias of these tools.
